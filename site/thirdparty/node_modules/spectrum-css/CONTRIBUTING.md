# Contributing to Spectrum

The goal of Spectrum is to create a CSS library that developers can drop-in
and be able to accomplish 90% of what they need to do with a combination of
pre-fabricated components and helper classes. It will be a fine line between
a well-designed and helpful library and a bloated mess, so with that in mind
feel free to open issues, have discussions, and contribute!
